# Cardmarket CI/CD & GitOps Project Assessment Documentation #

# Project Overview

This project demonstrates a fully automated CI/CD pipeline for a custom web application using modern DevOps and GitOps practices. The pipeline includes linting, code quality checks, containerized builds, vulnerability scanning, and automated deployment with semantic versioning and redundancy checks. The environment uses a local K3s Kubernetes cluster orchestrated with ArgoCD and ArgoCD Image Updater.


   * Main Objectives:

    - Build and maintain a secure, containerized web application (HTML/CSS/JS).

    - Implement robust CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions and GitOps with ArgoCD.

    - Ensure automated and reproducible deployment using GitOps principles.

    - Keep the container registry clean with semantic versioning and change detection.

    - Enable external access to the cluster for testing and security hardening.

```


1. Application Setup

   - Technology: Custom HTML, CSS, JS application.

   - Development Environment: VSCode on Windows 11 with WSL + Ubuntu.

   - Containerization: Docker, for consistent environment across local and CI/CD.

   * Steps:

     - Initialize the application in VSCode.

     - Structure the app in a directory called app/.

     - Ensure the application can run locally via index.html and supporting assets.

   * Tools:

        Visual Studio Code — IDE for development.

        Docker — containerization platform.

Why:

 - Docker ensures that the app runs identically across all environments, avoiding “it works on my machine” issues.



2. Continuous Integration (CI) Pipeline

* 2.1. Megalinter

   -  Purpose: Catch linting errors in HTML, CSS, and JS before code progresses.

   -  Configuration: Integrated as a GitHub Action.

   -  Outcome: Enforces coding standards, preventing syntax and style issues.




* 2.2. SonarCloud

   - Purpose: Analyze code quality, test coverage, and maintainability metrics.

   - Integration: GitHub Action triggered after Megalinter.

   - Outcome: Provides a dashboard to visualize code health.


Why:

 - SonarCloud adds a quality gate before Docker build, ensuring only healthy code is packaged.



2.3. Docker Build and Trivy Scan

Purpose: Containerize the application and scan for vulnerabilities.

Semantic Versioning (SemVer): 1.0.<github.run_number> used for patch version increments.

Redundancy Check: Build occurs only if app code changed, using Git diff check.

* GitHub Actions Step Example:

    - name: Check if app code changed
    run: |
        git fetch --depth=2
        if git diff --quiet HEAD^ HEAD -- ./app; then
        echo "No changes in app, skipping Docker build and Trivy scan."
        exit 0
        fi


Trivy Scan:

 - Fail workflow if vulnerabilities detected to prevent insecure images from being pushed.

Why:

 - This ensures only secure and updated container images are deployed, minimizing risk.



2.4. Docker Push to GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)

 - Purpose: Store container images in a secure registry.

 - SemVer and SHA Tags: latest, SHA, and 1.0.x tags for version traceability.

 - Redundancy Check: Push only if there are actual changes in app code.


  * Workflow Details:

    - Login to GHCR using a personal access token (GHCR_PAT).

    - Rebuild image in the push workflow since CI runners are ephemeral.

    - Push only if app code changed, reducing unnecessary storage usage.




3. Infrastructure Setup


 - OS & Environment: Windows 11, WSL, Ubuntu.

 - Kubernetes Cluster: K3s managed locally with Rancher for orchestration.

 - Deployment Replicas: 2 replicas for high availability.

 - Service: Exposes container via NodePort.

 - Access: ngrok was used for external testing and network hardening.


* Why K3s:

 - Lightweight, fast, and compatible with ArgoCD for GitOps deployment.

 - Easy to deploy locally on Windows with WSL.


4. Continuous Deployment (CD) via GitOps

* 4.1. ArgoCD

  - Purpose: Automates syncing of Git repository with Kubernetes cluster.

  -  Configuration: Deployment manifest and service synced automatically.

  -  Sync Options: prune: true, selfHeal: true for automated management.



* 4.2. ArgoCD Image Updater

  - Purpose: Automatically updates deployment images in Git and/or cluster.

  - Update Strategy: semver:~1.0 — picks the latest patch version.

  - Write-Back Method: git — commits updated image tags back to repository.

  - Secret: GitHub PAT stored as Kubernetes secret in argocd namespace.

* Example Application Annotation:

        annotations:
            argocd-image-updater.argoproj.io/image-list: interview-app=ghcr.io/akingbadeomosebi/interview-app
            argocd-image-updater.argoproj.io/interview-app.update-strategy: semver:~1.0
            argocd-image-updater.argoproj.io/interview-app.force-update: "true"
            argocd-image-updater.argoproj.io/write-back-method: git
            argocd-image-updater.argoproj.io/git-https-username-secret: argocd-image-updater-git
            argocd-image-updater.argoproj.io/git-https-password-secret: argocd-image-updater-git


* Why git write-back:

  - Keeps Git repository as source of truth.

  - Deployment history is preserved.

  - Enables reproducible rollbacks.



* 4.3. Deployment.yaml & Kustomize

      - Deployment replicas: 2 for HA.

      -  RollingUpdate strategy: maxUnavailable=0, maxSurge=1.

      - Resource limits: CPU and memory configured to prevent cluster overload.

      - Image tag placeholder: :latest or :1.0.x updated automatically by Image Updater.

    * Kustomize:

      - Manages overlays and customization for cluster manifests.

      - Enables ArgoCD to apply consistent deployment updates.


* 4.4. External Access & Hardening

     - ngrok WAF allows secure testing from outside your local network and other potential endpoint security, traffic policy, SSH public keys, IP Restrictions, Certificate authorizations, Traffic inspection,  implementations.

     - Use case: For QA testing and simulating public access.



5. Semantic Versioning and Redundancy Prevention

 * Semantic Versioning (SemVer): 1.0.<github.run_number> for patch updates.

 * Redundancy Prevention:

    - Docker images are only built/pushed when actual app code changes are detected.

    - Reduces registry storage usage.

Improves reproducibility and traceability.

6. Summary of CI/CD Flow

  - Developer pushes code → triggers Megalinter → SonarCloud → Docker Build & Trivy scan.

  - Docker images are tagged with SHA, latest, and SemVer.

  - If scan passes and code changed → Docker image pushed to GHCR.

  - ArgoCD Image Updater detects new SemVer image → commits updated image tag to Git.

  - ArgoCD syncs cluster → new deployment applied with rolling update strategy.

  - Application accessible externally via ngrok for testing/hardening.


7. Challenges Faced

* Redundant image builds:

  - Initially, every workflow run created new images even when code did not change.

  - Solved by Git diff check before Docker build.

* Ephemeral CI runners:

  - Docker images from build workflow did not persist to push workflow.

  - Solved by rebuilding image in push workflow.

* Git write-back authentication:

  - Needed GitHub PAT to commit image updates.

  - Ensured correct secret creation and permissions in argocd namespace.

* Semantic versioning integration:

  - Needed to automate patch increments without pushing unnecessary tags.

  - Solved using GitHub run number + code change detection.

* Local cluster access:

  - Exposing K3s cluster externally required ngrok and security considerations.



# Last minute implementation: Added NGROK in Agentic mode as a reverse proxy and WAF.


* Ngrok Integration for Interview App

    * Overview

        Ngrok is used to expose local services securely over the internet without directly exposing the cluster via a public IP. For  this project, we deployed Ngrok as an agent within the Kubernetes cluster, which forwards traffic to the interview-app service.

    * Key objectives of this integration:

      - Securely expose the application for external access.

      - Use IP restrictions to allow/deny traffic from specific ranges.

      - Enable request rate-limiting.

      - Ensure secrets (Ngrok authtoken) are not hard-coded using kubeseal.

      - Use ArgoCD for full GitOps deployment — no manual kubectl apply.


    * Architecture:

         -   [User] ---> [Ngrok Public URL] ---> [Ngrok Agent Pod] ---> [interview-app Service] ---> [Deployment]

    
        - The Ngrok Agent runs as a Deployment in the ngrok-operator namespace.

        - All sensitive data is stored in sealed secrets, which are encrypted and only decrypted inside the cluster.

        - ArgoCD monitors the Git repository for manifests and ensures the Ngrok agent is always deployed with the correct configuration.


    # Secrets Management

       * We used Bitnami SealedSecrets to handle sensitive data such as:

        - NGROK_AUTH_TOKEN (Ngrok authtoken)

        - Application username/password (if needed)


    * Steps:
        - 1  Create a raw secret manifest (ngrok-secret-raw.yaml) containing the authtoken:

          ```
          apiVersion: v1
             kind: Secret
             metadata:
                name: ngrok-secret
                namespace: ngrok-operator
             type: Opaque
             data:
                authtoken: <base64-encoded-token>
                ```

        - 2 Seal the secret using kubeseal with the cluster controller certificate:

           ``` 
           kubeseal --controller-namespace=kube-system \
                     --controller-name=sealed-secrets-controller \
                     -o yaml < ngrok-secret-raw.yaml > ngrok-secret.yaml
                     ```

        - 3 Commit the secret using kubeseal with the cluser controller certificate.

        - 4 ArgoCD applies the sealed secret and the controller decrypts it within the cluster.

            | This ensures sensitive information is never exposed in git or deployment files


    
## NGROK AGENT DEPLOYMENT


   * The Ngrok agent runs as a Kubernetes Deployment targeting the interview-app service. Configuration highlights:

     - Exposes HTTP traffic from Ngrok to the app service.

     -  IP restrictions using --allow-cidr and --deny-cidr.

     - Request rate-limiting with --rate-limit.

     -  Logging enabled to stdout for visibility.

     - Pulls the authtoken from the sealed secret.

    
# Accessing the Ngrok URL

    Once the Ngrok Agent Pod is running, the piblic URL is displayed in the pod logs:

    ```
    kubectl logs -l app=ngrok-agent -n ngrok-operator
    ```

  *  This URL can be shared for external access, while IP restrictions and rate-limiting ensure secure usage.


# Security and Policy Considerations

   - Secrets: All sensitive information is encrypted using SealedSecrets.

   - IP Restrictions: --allow-cidr and --deny-cidr limit access to approved networks.

   - Rate Limiting: --rate-limit protects against excessive requests.

   - Logging: All traffic and events are logged to stdout, enabling monitoring.

   - GitOps Compliance: No manual kubectl apply is used; ArgoCD manages all resources.


# Notes 

 * Success and Failures
     - Added and removed extra features as they were test features such as --auth, --cidr, etc to expand on the project.
     - CloudEndpoint CRD was discarded in favor of the agent endpoint, which is simpler for local development and ArgoCD-based deployment.
